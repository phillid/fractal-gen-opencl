# fractal-gen-opencl

This is a work-in-progress port of my simple fractal-gen software to OpenCL.
That software was an experiment of mine to generate mandelbrot (and some of
its cousins) fractals on CPU. This is my attempt at porting that software to
OpenCL so it can be used on a multitude of computation devices, including GPUs.

I had started to port it to CUDA in October 2016, but changed to CL because
of its portability and open nature.

Currently in early days.
